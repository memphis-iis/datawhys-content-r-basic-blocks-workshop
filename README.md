# datawhys-content-r-basic-blocks-workshop

This repository contains basic blocks training content for the [DataWhys](https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1918751&HistoricalAwards=false) project in the form of a JupyterLab notebook (.ipynb files).

This notebook is completely portable to all JupyterLab environments but requires the [Blockly R extension](https://github.com/aolney/jupyterlab-blockly-r-extension) for the full user experience.

These materials are in the R language. 
For a full course of R data science training materials, see [here](https://github.com/memphis-iis/datawhys-content-notebooks-r).

The content here is designed for users who already have minimal experience with statistical analysis but no experience in R, Jupyter, or blocks programming. 

If you've never used Jupyter or want to try the Blockly extension, check out the tutorial video below.
